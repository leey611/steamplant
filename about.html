                <h3>Overarchivin: Code, Fab, Future Relatedness</h3>
                <p>Overarchivin: Code, Fab, Future Relatedness is an inquiry-based collaborative project focusing on the housing conditions in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The project aims to navigate the intersection of self, objects, and everyday living through lectures and collaborative making sessions involving code, fabrication, and technology.</p>
                <p>This project views archiving as a collaborative act for understanding, mapping, and extracting to create a generative space for learning about human-object relations.</p>

            <h2>1. ORIGIN</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This project stemmed from an online workshop Yu & Tzu had held at CCFEST & PCDTW, which was called 'I AM: CODING MY THING.'
                </p>
                <img src="assets/origin1.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    In this workshop, we invited participants to put their personal belongings on the axes of certain criterias: which can be release-hold, personal-public, or other criterias, depending on how participants define their object group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the classroom, each participant will have their own object map, visualizing the object-daily life relation. Through p5js, Yu will lead the class to transfer the map into a coded shape, which can be interactive through clicking and pulling with the mouse.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overarchivin started from here…<br>
                    “How to look at object-human relation, when this map is seen? what kind of discussion can be triggered?”

            <h2>2. SUSTAIN</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    With the support from Pratt STEMplant, we got a chance to continue this project with a more diverse approach. Instead of randomly choosing objects to explore, we turned our vision to where we lived, our neighborhood, Sunset Park, and those objects “lived” near us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We admired how artists can contribute as a researcher, like Jeffrey Yoo Warren’s research project with Library of Congress, Seeing Lost Enclaves–exploring the potential for multifaceted remembrance and correction through virtually reconstructing the landscape and the scenes of Providence’s Chinatown with the supporting archives. Another project, Objournalist (物敘）, found by an ordinary Hong Konger, focuses on curating objects to record and tell Hong Kongers stories, including activism in Hong Kong and their protesting style.

            <h2>3. The Objects</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Makers create archives for reviving their fading/past neighborhood, to uphold and document their cultural belongings… As resident-not-as-citizens, Yu and I slept on a question: What we’ve learned as a resident-not-as-citizen in Sunset Park through the object curating? By speculating, embedding ourselves into the archive of residency history, we situate OVERARCHIVIN as a portal for resident-not-as-citizens' object collection, to document and explore the reflexive nature of daily objects.
